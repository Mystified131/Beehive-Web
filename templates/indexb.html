You can use this page to add text to the "hive", or database.</br>
The code automatically breaks the text into 5-word phrases.</br>
Each phrase is stored separately.</br>
The more you (or a business) use your own hive, the more you build your own collection of phrases.</br>
The code indicates how often the same phrase is submitted or queried.</br>
You can query the hive, asking for key text-- relevent phrases are listed in order of activity.</lbr>
Hence, the "hive mind" is steadily developed, so that after a period, actual low- to mid- priority e-mails can be deleted.</br>
What remains are the phrases they contained, as a group.</br>
