# Beehive-Web
This is a simple python code model designed to solve the problem of unstructured data.

You can use the app to add text to the "hive", or database.
The code automatically breaks the text into 5-word phrases.
Each phrase is stored separately.
The more you (or a business) use your own hive, the more you build your own collection of phrases.
The code indicates how often the same phrase is used.
You can query the hive, asking for key text-- relevent phrases are listed in order of use.
Hence, the "hive mind" is steadily developed, so that after a period, actual low- to mid- priority e-mails can be deleted.
What remains are the phrases they contained, as a group.
