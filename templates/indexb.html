<li>You can use this page to add text to the "hive", or database.</li>
<li>The code automatically breaks the text into 5-word phrases.</li>
<li>Each phrase is stored separately.</li>
<li>The more you (or a business) use your own hive, the more you build your own collection of phrases.</li>
<li>The code indicates how often the same phrase is submitted or queried.</li>
<li>You can query the hive, asking for key text-- relevent phrases are listed in order of activity.</li>
<li>Hence, the "hive mind" is steadily developed, so that after a period, actual low- to mid- priority e-mails can be deleted.</li>
<li>What remains are the phrases they contained, as a group.</li>
</ul>
